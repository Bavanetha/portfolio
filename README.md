# portfolio
I built this project by using HTML and CSS . In this webpage I created 5 sections namely home , about me , skills , projects and contact .
I create navigation bar for the above mentioned sections so that when you click them it will scroll the webpage to the corresponding section . I have also used HOVER property to select the menus in navigation bar .
I also used some of the properties of css like background-color , text-align , width , height , overflow so on.
